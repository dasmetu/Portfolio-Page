    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        I was born in Austria on July 7th in 1996. I finished my elementary education there, and when I was
        <br/>12, I moved to Turkey with my family, where I finished my secondary education.
        <br/>For University I moved back to Vienna. After 3 years I decided to change my major to something
        <br/>more language study-related. Which led me to Translation Studies in my parent's hometown
        <br/>university.
